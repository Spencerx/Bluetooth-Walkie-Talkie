<h2> Problem Description </h2>
<p>
    A Walkie-talkie is a two way radio that allows communication between two or more parties. There are several accessories and devices that can become Walkie talkie. In the current mobile world, there are multiple implementations of Android Walkie Talkies over WiFi. But our project focuses on how to make two mobile android devices function as walkie-talkies over a bluetooth connection. This eliminates the need for a network connection all-together and makes this application more practical for areas with weak signal or no signal.

<p>
    There are two assumptions that are made for the environment: the devices are already aware of each other (paired prior to app launch) and they are within communication range of each other. Communication will take place between the devices similar to a push-to-talk application. This means that when one device is sending audio data, the other device is receiving (not transmitting) and vice-versa.
